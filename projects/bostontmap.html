  <h4>Boston T Map Redesign</h4>
  <p>
  In 2013, the MBTA launched a campaign to redesign the system map. After being unimpressed by the results of the design competition, I decided to tackle the project on my own. The MBTA Map Redesign is a personal exploration of how maps influence travel decisions and how design of the maps impact the way people perceive space once inside the subway network.
  </p>
  <p>
Heavily influenced Paris, my redesign of the MBTA map uses many of the principles on deciding what to show and what not to show. Key considerations were given to symbologies, line widths, and the representation of geography. This new subway map helps
to inform the user of the variety of modes within the system, such as on the Green Line where trains both operate at street level and underground. These distinctions are necessary in determining the quality of service provided throughout the system. Out of system transfers also are depicted to prevent circuitous travel patterns in the system, such as Cleveland Circle and Reservoir, which are a stones throw a way from each other but shown as far apart on the existing map.
<p>
In addition to the subway map, I also redesigned the MBTA bus map.
